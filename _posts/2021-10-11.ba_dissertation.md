* Used Inventory for Parent and Peer Attachment (Parent subscale) (IPPA; Armsden & Greenberg, 1987) to measure parental attachment and Identity Style Inventory-5 (Berzonsky et al., 2013) to measure identity style among youth.
* Data was collected from 119 participants. Informational identity and parental attachment were found to have a very weak relationship. There were no gender differences.
